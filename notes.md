## Section 1

- no notes needed here really..

## Section 2

- startup ideas:
  - something DnD related
    - druid wild shape tracker
    - long/short rest manager
  - choose-your-own-adventure
  - KGLW album picker?
    - pretty much just a peronality test

## Section 3

- github notes (for assignment)
  - what I've learned from this assignment:
    - github is complicated lol
    - using the built in git-manager in vscode is the way to go for me
    - **Practice with the github markdown**

## Section 4

- SSH (remote shell) into server: 
  - ```âžœ ssh -i [key pair file] ubuntu@[ip adress]```
  - ip adress (elastic I think): ```3.95.142.128```
- **DON'T FORGET TO PROPERLY RELEASE THE ELASTIC IP ADDRESS AT THE END OF THE SEMESTER** (in addition to terminating my instance)

- Attempting to get a fun domain name.  ```griffinspacejam.click``` is still registering as "in progress"
