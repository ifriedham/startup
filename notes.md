# Section 1

- no notes needed here really..

# Section 2

- startup ideas:
  - something DnD related
    - druid wild shape tracker
    - long/short rest manager
  - choose-your-own-adventure
  - KGLW album picker?
    - pretty much just a peronality test

# Section 3

- github notes (for assignment)
  - what I've learned from this assignment:
    - github is complicated lol
    - using the built in git-manager in vscode is the way to go for me
    - **Practice with the github markdown**

# Section 4

- SSH (remote shell) into server:
  - `âžœ ssh -i [key pair file] ubuntu@[ip adress OR domain name]`
    - ip adress (elastic I think): ``` 3.95.142.128 ```
    - domain name: ``` griffinspacejam.click ```
- **DON'T FORGET TO PROPERLY RELEASE THE ELASTIC IP ADDRESS AT THE END OF THE SEMESTER** (in addition to terminating my instance)

- Attempting to get a fun domain name. `griffinspacejam.click` is still registering as "in progress"
  - SUCCESS! my domain name is now `griffinspacejam.click`

-**IMPORTANT**: don't forget about the region in the AWS. If something isn't right (ex: server just not showing up at all..), doublecheck that the region is set to `N. Virginia`
